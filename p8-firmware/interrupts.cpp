/* 
  The interrupt handler works as follows:
  If the handler routine (below) is called, we know that there has been a change in state of any pin configured
  So we first check which pin was set that sent the interrupt for each pin configured to send an interrupt,
  then we change the interrupt configuration on that pin to only trigger when the inverse of the current read 
  value is seen. This means that an interrupt will only fire on a TRANSITION of state of any of the interrupt pins.
  This is effectively the same behaviour as GPIOTE LoToHi or HiToLo interrupts, however it has the added benefit 
  of drawing less power.
  Finally we only set the specific interrupt flag if the correct state of the interrupt is seen, for example
  only setting a button interrupt when the button is HIGH (since the button is active high)

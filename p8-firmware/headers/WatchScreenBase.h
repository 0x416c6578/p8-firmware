/*
  This class should be inherited by other screens so that they follow the correct
  blueprint Methods should be overriden if they will be used by that screen,
  otherwise they will do nothing
  
  Notes on C++ inheritance:
  For a class to override a superclass's methods, those methods must be declared as virtual
  This means that the methods are bound at runtime, so there is flexibility on what method is called (ie runtime polymorphism works)
  If these methods below were declared as non-virtual, any call to the same method of a SUBCLASS would result in the method of the BASE CLASS being called, since the method binding is done at compile time
  So by default all of these methods just do nothing, and it is up to subclasses to (optionally) implement alternate behaviour
  This class is NOT an interface, since the methods are all implemented
  An interface would have to have at least one "pure virtual" method, ie a method defined as `virtual void method() = 0`
  This would declare the class as being abstract, so objects of that type could not be instantiated
  
  TODO: convert to abstract class after more research
